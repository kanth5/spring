@Component

// When a prototype bean is injected into a singleton bean, it loses its prototype behavior and acts as a singleton.

//@Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)

// The prototype bean doesnâ€™t get autowired into the singleton bean at the time of its creation. Instead, a proxy or placeholder object is autowired.
// The proxy adds a level of indirection. When the developer requests the prototype bean from Spring, a proxy is created and is returned by the application
// context. The proxy mode allows Spring container to inject a new object into the singleton bean when a method on the proxy object is called.

// After making this change in the code, a proxy Movie object is created, and we get a new Movie bean when the ContentBasedFilter bean calls the getMovie()
// method on the proxy object. The proxy resolves the Movie instance and calls getMovie() on the resolved instance.
